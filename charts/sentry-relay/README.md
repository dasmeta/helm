## This helm chart allows to create sentry relay app in kubernetes cluster https://docs.sentry.io/product/relay/

### Here are values.yaml file structures for creation relay with sentry cloud by supported proxy, managed or static modes by using minimum configs
### NOTE: 
 - By default it creates relay on proxy mode with DaemonSet workload
 - In case you created sentry cloud on europe region the upstream value is in form https://<ORGANIZATION-ID>.ingest.de.sentry.io
 - It should be possible to use this chart also for non sentry cloud setups, but this is not tested yet


### "proxy" mode (simplest mode without additional configs)
```yaml
# file values-proxy-mode.yaml
upstream: https://<ORGANIZATION-ID>.ingest.sentry.io
```

### "managed" mode (https://docs.sentry.io/product/relay/getting-started/#creating-credentials)
```yaml
# file values-managed-mode.yaml
mode: managed
upstream: https://<ORGANIZATION-ID>.ingest.sentry.io
credentials:
  secretKey: "<SECRET-KEY>"
  publicKey: "<PUBLIC-KEY>"
  id: "<ID>"
```

### "static" mode (https://docs.sentry.io/product/relay/projects/)
```yaml
# file values-static-mode.yaml
mode: static

    slug: "<PROJECT-SLUG>"
    disabled: false
